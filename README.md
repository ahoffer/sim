# Simple Simulator

Simple framework for discrete simulator.

## TODO Get with Phil. Ask him about the todos in the code. 
- Also ask him about how to instrument the thing with micrometer (?)
- Get some help "Spring bootifying it -- inject objects instead of new-ing them up"
- Logging. How to work reporting/logging?
- Visualization?
